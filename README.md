# MIT_SmartPhysio
The Smart Physio project completed under the MIT Media Lab Design Innovation Workshop 2015

This is the Smart Physio project conceptualised and prototyped by  Vinayak Mathur,Sartaj Singh ,Vibhoor Sood, Agrima Seth and Ankit Kotak under the Design Innovation Workshop 2015 Organized by MIT Media Lab.
 We aim to make physiotherapy accessible to everyone with the help of a web camera . We will provide quality videos as well as real time feedback to the user about his movements using motion tracking.We use Python along with Open CV to track the user as he performs the exercise and tell him in realtime whether he is doing it properly or not.More details about the project can be found here-
