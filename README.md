# MIT_SmartPhysio
The Smart Physio project completed under the MIT Media Lab Design Innovation Workshop 2015

This is the Smart Physio project conceptualised and prototyped by  Vinayak Mathur,Sartaj Singh ,Vibhoor Sood, Agrima Seth and Ankit Kotak under the Design Innovation Workshop 2015 Organized by MIT Media Lab.
 We aim to make physiotherapy accessible to everyone with the help of a web camera . We will provide quality videos as well as real time feedback to the user about his movements using motion tracking.We use Python along with Open CV to track the user as he performs the exercise and tell him in realtime whether he is doing it properly or not.More details about the project can be found here-

We identified that readily available healthcare is a problem faced by many senior citizens and one of the most common ailments that they face require the attention of a physiotherapist. Many don't have access to a physiotherapist we hoped to remedy that. 
      Smart Physio is a platform wherein you can learn physiotherapy exercises from a well curated set of videos anytime and from anywhere. Another fact that we noticed in our interaction with senior citizens was that if the exercises where not done properly they could cause more harm than good. To ensure that this doesn't happen we track the users as they perform the exercise using the webcam of the laptop and give real time feedback, that is if a person is not doing the exercise correctly he is corrected in real time.
     The whole project was developed in python and for the real time tracking we used OpenCv,wherein we tracked specific action points as the user did those exercises and checked the movement of those points whit the movement of the trainer in the video, It was fun developing smart physio and hopefully it made a positive impact in the world.
